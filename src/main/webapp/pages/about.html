            <p>Stream2Grid is a proof-of-concept that takes a small live feed from Twitter's status sample stream &amp; feeds that information into
            various queues for processing. The information is then parsed & placed into an in-memory data grid linked to a rules engine session that
            identifies trending hashtags and users across the stream sample.</p>

                    <p>RabbitMQ queues are used to temporarily hold status update info by category until they can be marshalled and
                        stored in the data grid. Given the speed of the live Twitter update stream, this step prevents latency and stalling
                        of API queries.</p>

                    <p>Expert (core engine) module is utilized to generate stateful sessions which parse trending information from the stream-store data grid.
                    The rules base can be expanded to better earmark points of interest which could then be directly queried against the Twitter API to get
                    more detailed results and better trend analysis.</p>

                    The routing is on par with my expectations coming from BackBone, but the HTML integration is much sleeker than templating.</p>

                    <p>EC2 instances are used for hosting the RabbitMQ & Hazelcast servers. An EBS-backed medium sized Ubuntu server hosts both
                    services. This could easily be spun up to accomodate larger stream loads by implementing more nodes and placing an EC2 load
                    balancer in front of each cluster.</p>

                    <p>Mockito testing framework is used for all mock unit tests and integration stubbing. If you've used one, you've used most, but
                    I'm pretty fond of Mockito - the documentation is clean and functionality slightly more extensive than others, but static mocking
                    remains an issue, for which I've become accustomed to EasyMock and PowerMock to overcome.</p>
